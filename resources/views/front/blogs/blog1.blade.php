            Despite tough economic times, many organizations are still tasked with hiring in volume — and quickly. With businesses opening again and companies starting to adapt to the current situation we also see an increase in the demand for certain roles. Ecommerce and logistics companies must meet increasing demands and prepare for year-end holiday shopping. Other companies try to make use of the situation to win over skilled employees.

            Virtual hiring helps reduce the risks of exposure to the pandemic, enabling employers with high-volume, hiring requirements to prescreen more safely, schedule and interview candidates at scale. In fact, 86% of organizations are now using virtual hiring technologies to acquire new talent.

          <h1>Benefits</h1>
          <p>
            Digital tools and platforms minimize health risks by greatly reducing, if not eliminating, the need for face-to-face interactions that typically occur during the hiring process. Other benefits include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="list-item">Enhanced efficiency.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Recruiters and hiring managers can interview more candidates in less time, speeding up the hiring process and potentially yielding better results. Tools such as Hire Talent, online assessments and virtual job tryouts can help employers more efficiently handle interviews and candidate screening at scale.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li class="list-item">Low cost per hire.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Virtual hiring’s faster time to hire and onboard new employees reduces your overall cost per hire. Automating some manual tasks, such as scheduling interviews with candidates, can reduce the time recruiters spend on seasonal hiring initiatives
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li class="list-item">Wider candidate pool.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                With virtual hiring, employers can consider candidates for temporary remote work positions, such as customer service representatives, with less concern for traditional geographical constraints. Let’s say your call center employees will be working from home instead of onsite at a call center. This allows you to look further afield for candidates, thereby widening your potential talent pool.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li class="list-item">Better interview panels.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In some cases, particularly for high-level hires, multiple people may need to interview a candidate at one time. Assembling a diverse panel of the most appropriate interviewers — especially when your company’s workforce is dispersed — may be logistically easier to accomplish virtually, which can, in turn, yield better results.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li class="list-item">Reduced ghosting.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                When unemployment rates remained low and the labour market was highly competitive, ghosting was a big problem. 83% of companies experienced no-shows for scheduled interviews or new hires who failed to appear for their first day. However, virtual hiring technology can help reduce ghosting by automating and streamlining initial communications (such as RSVPs) between applicants and hiring managers and recruiters. And because virtual hiring helps save candidates’ time and effort, talent professionals have reported a reduction in ghosting.

          <h1>A few inherent challenges to hiring virtually</h1>
          <p>Regardless of technologies used, virtual hiring comes with a few inherent challenges: </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="list-item">Lack of confidence in hiring decisions.
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Recruiters and hiring managers aren’t always comfortable hiring someone without meeting them in person, even if that person is filling a temporary, seasonal job. In fact, according to interviews conducted for Indeed’s global research project, some employers still conduct the final part of the hiring process in-person. Most recruiters aren’t accustomed to making hiring decisions under these circumstances. So, it’s up to them to get over the fear of making a bad decision, and to learn to better assess candidates interviewed virtually.</li>
            </ul>

            <li class="list-item">Logistics.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Hiring virtually can present logistical puzzles or limitations to figure out. While virtual hiring can help you reach a more diverse candidate, it can also limit interviewing for candidates without access to high-speed internet or necessary hardware. And there are additional logistical considerations to make after making the hire: Companies need to adjust their onboarding processes for remote workers, distribute needed equipment and virtually set up access to systems. While none of these challenges are insurmountable, all should be factored into your planning.</li>
